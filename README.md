### Abstract
Large scale production of algal biofuels is mostly limited to outdoor cultivation where weather variability and CO2 supply costs are concerns that limit commercial viability. 
Here we explore commercial scale biofuel cultivation using Chlorella sorokiniana SLA-04, an algal strain that only grows in extreme alkaline solutions (pH > 10). 
This extreme alkaline cultivation medium, provides incidental benefits such as protection against other competing strains, tempering influence of weather on productivity, and perhaps more importantly, allowing for all or most of the required CO2 to be captured directly from air.
This study utilizes a life cycle analysis & techno-economic analysis modeling framework to analyze this new production process and its financial implications for large-scale production of algal biofuel using the SLA-04 strain in a high pH-high alkalinity cultivation medium. 
The potential for lower cost production is compared against that of a previously explored strain, Nannochloropsis oceanica, grown in a neutral pH solution with sparged CO2. 
Results suggest that using bicarbonate, or potentially Trona, as the primary inorganic carbon source that maintains the high pH in the growth medium presents numerous advantages over sparged CO2 such as reduced facility costs, operating expense and life-cycle impacts under variable market- and weather-related growth conditions.
